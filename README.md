# CVE_scanner
Simple Android vulnerability scanner. Shows CVEs based on Android version.

Requirements:
Android 5.0+

Used https://www.cvedetails.com/ API in process. After the request a response is received in the form of a list of potential vulnerabilities in JSON format. 

I found it necessary to show the following information:

•	Cve_id (Unique identifier of a certain vulnerability)

•	Cvss score (A standard that can be used to determine the severity of a vulnerability based on its simplicity of use and results)

•	If you click on the vulnerability, you can see its brief description in English
